# WoWBnB - a simple addon to create shareable links to your house both ingame and out!

## Core:
    - slash commands main interface
    - options menu 
    - alias `/wbnb`
## Commands:
/wowbnb:
    - help menu to print available commands and use cases.

/wowbnb-share:
    - Copy to clipboard displayed in a frameXML box.
    - encodes as a raw macro string so shareing does NOT require addon.

---
TODO:
/wowbnb-visit:
    - use should be `/wowbnb-vist $encodedstring` OR if empty present a paste box with framexml.

- feature to save locations to houses for use later (persist after game close)
