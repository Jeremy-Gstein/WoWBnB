# **WoWBnB** 
*a simple addon to create shareable links to your house both in-game and out!*

## Core:
- slash commands main interface
   
## Commands:
`/wowbnb`:
- Copy to clipboard displayed in a small text-box highlighted and ready to copy.
- encodes as a raw macro string so sharing does NOT require addon for visitors.
- alias `/wbnb`

## Example Usage:
- *player logs into account and goes to a plot that they own.*
- In chat type the slash command: `/wowbnb`
- *Notice the popup in center of screen with a formatted /run macro highlighted*
- Press Control+C (Copy) and the window closes. **note** Clicking the small [x] in the corner or [Okay] button
- Paste the macro to a friend, reddit, discord etc.. since we use native UI api __when sharing with others, they will **NOT** need to have the addon installed.__
